> TL;DR: We propose to add support for the UTF8 characters in Prometheus metric and label names. While tsdb and the Prometheus code already support arbitrary strings, PromQL and the exposition format need a quoting syntax to make these values distinguishable.

## Why

We wish to use Prometheus as a backing database for other metrics implementations like Open Telemetry that use Prometheus-illegal characters, like '.'. Establishing a quoting syntax avoids the need for verbose and unreadable character encoding schemes, as well as non-roundtripable replacement schemes like using underscore for all unsupported characters.

### Pitfalls of the current solution

The current recommendation is to replace all unsupported characters with underscores. This substitution cannot be reversed, creating possible name collisions. Furthermore, the change in metric names between original write and eventual read can be confusing for end users.

## Goals

* Allow arbitrarily-named metric and label names to be submitted to Prometheus.
* Allow these metric and label names to be easily queried back with PromQL.
* Ensure that Go templating supports quoted label names.
* Provide a graceful backwards-compatible fallback for query clients that do not support utf8 metric and label names in returned results.

### Audience

The audience for this change is very broad. It would allow all end-users of Prometheus to use richer metric names. Tool and service authors will want to be aware of the change and support the new character set.

## Non-Goals


## How

We propose the following change in syntax to PromQL and the exposition format:

* Label names may be quoted
* A quoted string inside the label set (`{}`) without an operator is default-assigned to the label name `__name__` (the metric name).
* Style prefers, but does not enforce, that the operatorless string is the first term in the label set.

Furthermore, in the exposition format, the TYPE, HELP, and UNIT lines can have quotes around the metric name.

### Syntax Examples:

Basic quoted metric:
`{"my.dotted.metric", region="east"}`

Quoted label name:
`{"my.dotted.metric", "http.status"=~"5.."}`

Classic metrics do not need to be treated differently:
`sum(rate(regular_metric{region="east"}[5m]))`

If the user decides to put a classic metric inside the selector, it still needs to be quoted:
`sum(rate({"regular_metric", region="east"}[5m]))`

Syntax if the metric has a quote:
`sum(rate({'my "quoted" metric', region="east"}[5m]))`

Recording Rule Syntax:
`sum(rate({"my.dotted.metric:errors:rate5m", region="east"}[5m]))`

Unicode escaping:
`{"emoji metric: ðŸ’© or \u1F4A9"}`

### Implementation

Implementing this feature will require updates to several Prometheus libraries. These updates will be written so that functionality does not change for existing users and builds, and will only be enabled when certain flags are flipped or options turned on.

Main tasks:

* Change / update code locations that check for a "valid" metric name.
* Update text generators to generate the new syntax when a metric must be quoted.
* Update parsers to parse the new syntax.
* Add a way for backends to escape metric names for clients that do not support the full character set.
* NEW API VERSION???

### prometheus/common

We propose we rename the function IsValidMetricName in the common libarary, to "MetricNameRequiresQuoting" or similar. This is because all metric names will now be "valid", but some metric names will require special handling. This will not to be the default behavior.

One case of this special handling is in the openmetrics_create.go and text_create.go files. They will detect if the metric names require quoting, and if so, use the new syntax when creating the text format. 

Other repositories use this check to filter out "bad" metric names, and those checks will have to be optional via a flag.

### prometheus/client_golang

The golang library checks that metrics have a valid name when NewDesc is called. We can create a new parallel function, NewDescUTF8 (or similar) that will bypass the validity check.

### prometheus/prometheus

Prometheus itself needs updates to its lexers and parsers to support reading the new exposition syntax and promql syntax.

* openmetricslex
* promlex
* generated_parser

Prometheus will also need to support queries and responses from old clients that do not support the new syntax. 

UH OH QUOTING!!!! UGLY BUT WHATEVER

### mimir

Mimir has a check in ValidateLabels for valid metric names that will need to be updated.

## Alternatives

We considered a different syntax, like:

`"my.dotted.metric"{"label"="value"}`

While quoted strings are literals in PromQL, the combination of string+"{}" is currently invalid, so it is available for this extension if we want. While this WHY NOT???
